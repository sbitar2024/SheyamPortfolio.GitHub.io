# Adult Cancer Survival
## Objective: 

 - This project focuses on analyzing survival rates among adult cancer patients. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and survival modeling using various statistical techniques to identify key factors influencing survival rates. 
## Execution: 

- using Python pandas, seaborn, numpy, sklean and matplotlib I was able to train a model called Random Survival Forest - this is to predict survival based on cancer type
